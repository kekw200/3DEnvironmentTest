# EXTREMELY WIP
Very rough personal project where I try to implement a 3D graphic environment using OpenGL + GLFW (+ eventually probably Dear ImGui) through, partially, trial and error (and partially google, stack overflow, documentation and learnopengl usage), in order to learn the aforementioned along with C++.
Which is why the code is a mess right now.

# Current state
Movement and drawing of crudely represented meshes is working.

# Imminent to-dos
- Move transformations from C++ functions to vertex shader
- Mouse input (rotation)
- Better mesh handling

(Basically fix up all the improvised spaghetti)

Then will start working on the rest like textures, ligthing, interactivity and so on.
